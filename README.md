A Python Script for Distant Worlds 2 - Geology &amp; Biology Dept.

Purpose:<br>
If you just scanned a planet that has POIs on it, run the script and it will open up the scouting report form
with most fields already filled in.

How to "install":<br>
1: Install Python 3.x. https://www.python.org/<br>
2: Download/copy the script.<br>
3: Place it into the same folder that your Journal Files get written to.<br>
   Usually that's C:\Users\<username>\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous<br>
4: Open up the Script in a text editor and change your CMDR Name. It's the 7th Line, in the marks.
   
Usage:<br>
If you have Python installed, double-clicking the python script should suffice. You can also bind it to a keymap - google is your friend. :)
